Forecaster
-----

I use this script to report the weather to my phone daily at 7:30, scheduled in cron. The main purpose is to know if
 the weather became colder or warmer.
  
I use [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev/) for the forecast and historic weather data and 
[Pushover](https://pushover.net) for notifications to iPhone. Pushovers also works great with Android devices.
